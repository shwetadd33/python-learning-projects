# Python Learning Projects

This repository contains Python scripts and exercises that I created while learning Python as a beginner. The goal is to document my learning journey and provide helpful examples for anyone new to Python.

## üìö Overview

This repository includes a variety of Python files that demonstrate basic concepts, problem-solving techniques, and small projects completed during my learning process.

## üõ†Ô∏è Getting Started

To run the Python scripts in this repository, you'll need to have Python installed on your computer. You can download the latest version of Python from the official [Python website](https://www.python.org/).

### Cloning the Repository

To get started, clone the repository using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/shwetadd33/python-learning-projects.git
cd python-learning-projects
```

### Running the Scripts
You can run any of the Python scripts using the command line or your preferred code editor. For example, to run a script named example.py, use:

```bash
python example.py
```

### üìù Contents
Here is a brief overview of some key concepts covered by the scripts in this repository:

* Basic Syntax: Learn the basics of Python syntax, including variables, data types, and comments.
* Control Flow: Explore if-else statements, loops (for and while), and control flow mechanisms.
* Functions: Understand how to define and call functions, use parameters, and return values.
* Lists and Dictionaries: Work with Python‚Äôs built-in data structures for managing collections of data.
* File Handling: Learn to read from and write to files, handling data in different formats.
* Error Handling: Basics of try-except blocks for managing exceptions and errors.


### üåü Highlights
* Beginner-friendly code examples
* Each script is well-commented to explain the logic and purpose
* Progressive learning approach, from basics to slightly more complex topics

### üì¢ Contributing
* This project is personal and aimed at learning, but feedback and suggestions are always welcome. If you see something that could be improved or want to share your learning experiences, feel free to reach out!

### ü§ù Acknowledgments
